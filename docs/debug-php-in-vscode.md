# General

- Working on php, mysql website through xampp on localhost.
- All code is in local repository and copy the code to cp -r attendance /opt/lampp/htdocs/ manually each time i do some development stage.
- develop code with vscode. 
- Add ability to debug the code, to see all variables, how they expand in similar way I do it with python, to go through the localhost/my-app and stop on vscode on debug if set.


Setting up debugging for PHP in VSCode requires a few steps to get started. Here's a general guide on how you can set up a debugging environment for a PHP application like yours:

1. **Install Xdebug**:
   - Xdebug is a PHP extension that provides debugging capabilities. You'll need to install it and configure it with your PHP setup in XAMPP. You can download it from the Xdebug official website.

1. **Adjust config**:
   - After downloading, add the extension to your `php.ini` file (usually located in `/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini` for XAMPP on Linux) with settings similar to:
     ```
     [Xdebug]
     zend_extension="/opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20190902/xdebug.so" # The path to the xdebug.so file
     xdebug.mode=debug
     xdebug.start_with_request=yes
     xdebug.client_port=9003
     xdebug.client_host="127.0.0.1"
     ```
   - Restart your XAMPP server to enable Xdebug.

2. **VSCode Extensions**:
   - Install the PHP Debug extension in VSCode, which is an adapter between Xdebug and the Visual Studio Code editor.

3. **Configure VSCode**:
   - In VSCode, go to the debugging section (you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + D` on Linux/Windows or `Cmd + Shift + D` on Mac).
   - Click on the gear icon to create a new launch configuration. Select PHP. This will create a `launch.json` file in your `.vscode` folder.
   - Edit the `launch.json` file to match your setup. Here is a sample configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
           "type": "php",
           "request": "launch",
           "port": 9003,
           "pathMappings": {
             "/opt/lampp/htdocs/attendance": "${workspaceFolder}/attendance"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - The `pathMappings` will link your local source code to the equivalent path on the server.

4. **Listen for Debug Connections**:
   - In VSCode, start listening for debug connections by clicking on the green play button in the debug sidebar after selecting the "Listen for Xdebug" configuration.
   
5. **Set Breakpoints and Test**:
   - Set breakpoints in your PHP code by clicking on the left-hand side of the line numbers in your VSCode editor.
   - Open your web browser and navigate to your PHP application (e.g., `http://localhost/my-app`). If `xdebug.start_with_request` is set to `yes`, Xdebug will attempt to connect to the debugger client as soon as the PHP script starts.

6. **Browser Configuration**:
   - If you only want debugging to start when you decide, you can use browser extensions or GET/POST/COOKIE variables to trigger Xdebug. For example, with the Xdebug browser extension, you can start the debugger by clicking a button in your browser.

7. **Using a Proxy**:
   - If you are using a proxy, ensure that the correct port is open and that VSCode is configured to listen to it.

Once youâ€™ve got everything set up, you should be able to step through your code, watch variables, and get stack traces, which makes it much easier to diagnose issues with your application.

Remember, this is a general guide and your specific setup might need some adjustments, especially with respect to paths and versions of software being used.

## install and confirm xdebug is enabled on ubuntu-2204

To install and confirm that Xdebug is enabled on Ubuntu 22.04 for use with XAMPP, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Install Xdebug

XAMPP comes with a pre-compiled version of Xdebug in its PHP extensions directory, but if it's not there or you want to ensure you have the latest version, you can install it manually.

Check your PHP version first because you need to download the Xdebug version that matches your PHP version:

```sh
/opt/lampp/bin/php -v
```

Visit the Xdebug website and use the [Xdebug wizard](https://xdebug.org/wizard) by pasting the output of the following command:

```sh
/opt/lampp/bin/php -i | xclip -sel clip
```

It will analyze the output and give you instructions on which Xdebug version to download and how to install it. Generally, it would be something like this:

```sh
cd /tmp
wget http://xdebug.org/files/xdebug-x.y.z.tgz
tar -xvzf xdebug-x.y.z.tgz
cd xdebug-x.y.z
/opt/lampp/bin/phpize
./configure --with-php-config=/opt/lampp/bin/php-config
make
sudo cp modules/xdebug.so /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-xxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xdebug-x.y.z.tgz` with the actual filename you are instructed to download.

### 2. Update `php.ini`

After installing Xdebug, you need to configure it in the `php.ini` file. Open it with a text editor:

```sh
sudo nano /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini
```

Then, add or update the following lines at the end of the file:

```ini
[Xdebug]
zend_extension="/opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-xxxxxxxx/xdebug.so" ; Ensure this path matches the location and name of your Xdebug extension
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.client_port=9003
xdebug.client_host="127.0.0.1"
```

Make sure to replace `/opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-xxxxxxxx/xdebug.so` with the correct path where the `xdebug.so` file is located.

### 3. Restart XAMPP

Restart the XAMPP server to apply the changes:

```sh
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
```

### 4. Confirm Xdebug Installation

To confirm that Xdebug is properly installed and configured, run:

```sh
/opt/lampp/bin/php -m | grep xdebug
```

Or for more detailed information:

```sh
/opt/lampp/bin/php -i | grep xdebug
```

You should see `xdebug` in the list of modules. If it's there, Xdebug is installed and should be ready to use with VSCode.

### 5. Debugging with VSCode

Don't forget to set up your VSCode by installing the PHP Debug extension and configuring `launch.json` as mentioned earlier in your VSCode workspace to connect with Xdebug for debugging.

Always make sure the version of Xdebug you download matches the PHP version you're running on XAMPP, as mismatched versions can lead to issues.
